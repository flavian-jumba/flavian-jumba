- ⚡ Fun fact:  Despite JavaScript being one of the core technologies of the web, JavaScript was initially designed to be a simple scripting language for adding interactivity to web pages. In fact, the first version of JavaScript was only 32 kilobytes in size! Today, it has evolved into a powerful language used for everything from front-end development to server-side applications with frameworks like Node.js.
